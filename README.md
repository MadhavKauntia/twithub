# TwitHub

TwitHub is a MERN stack application which allows a user to set their GitHub Contributions Calendar as their Twitter banner. This Calendar automatically updates each day based on the contributions of the user.

To see how the banner looks like, visit [my profile](https://www.twitter.com/MadhavKauntia) on Twitter.

Website is hosted on [TwitHub.xyz](https://www.twithub.xyz).

The application is completely free of cost. If you like it, please consider [buying me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/madhavkauntia). Cheers.
